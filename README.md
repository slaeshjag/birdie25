This abomination was concieved during the scene/lan party Birdie 25, for the game development compo.
It is pretty much a complete hack, pretty much everything is done as wrong as possible:

 - Thread safety is inexistant
 - Return values from library functions are never checked
 - Array/buffer bounds are never checked
 - ...

If you however do not value your physical and/or mental health; license is MIT.
Good luck getting it to compile and run properly though :p
